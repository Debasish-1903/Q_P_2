Description

Given an integer array 
n
u
m
s
, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 
64
-bit integer.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.


Input Format

First-line contains 
T
 - the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains 
n
 - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains 
n
 elements of the array 
n
u
m
s
.


Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum subarray product on a new line.
